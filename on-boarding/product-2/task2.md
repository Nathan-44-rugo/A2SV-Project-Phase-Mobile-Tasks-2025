# Task 2: Dart Basics - Building eCommerce Application

## Overview
Create a simple command-line eCommerce application using Dart. This application will allow users to add, view, edit, and delete products. Products should have a name, description, and price. The application should use OOP principles to organize the code and manage product data.

## Requirements

### Product Class
Create a class representing a product with the following properties:
- Name
- Description
- Price

### Product Manager Class
Create a class that manages products and includes the following methods:
- Add a new product
- View all products
- View a single product
- Edit a product (update name, description, price)
- Delete a product

## Task Verification

### Create a Repository
- Create a repository named **`2024-project-phase-mobile-tasks`**. This repository will be used for submitting all project phase tasks.

### Create a Folder
- Inside the repository, create a folder named **`on-boarding`**.

### Project Naming
- Create your project inside the **`on-boarding`** folder and name it based on the product number.
- Since this product is the second one, name the project folder **`product-2`**.

### Submission
- Once the project is completed, attach the GitHub link to the progress sheet.
